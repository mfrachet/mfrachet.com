From [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement):

> Progressive enhancement is a design philosophy that provides a baseline of essential content and functionality to as many users as possible, while delivering the best possible experience only to users of the most modern browsers that can run all the required code.

One great example of progressive enhancement is form handling in [Remix](https://remix.run/).

In Remix, you can create an almost regular HTML form, a function named `action` exported from the route module and there you go: the form is working **with and without JavaScript**.
It means that people disabling JavaScript in their browser, or people under specific constraints regarding their devices (or browsers, or low-connectivity regions) can still use the form and benefit from the feature.

Some people can stand that it's probably not necessary, and I agree. The thing is you have it for free. It's baked in and works using the same API no matter you submit the form from JavaScript or from the HTML form itself.

```tsx
// Copy/pasted from the Remix doc about action https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/action
export async function action({ request }: ActionFunctionArgs) {
  const body = await request.formData();
  const title = body.get("title");
  const todo = await fakeCreateTodo({ title });

  return redirect(`/todos/${todo.id}`);
}

export default function AddTodo() {
  return (
    <Form method="post">
      <input type="text" name="title" />
      <button type="submit">Create Todo</button>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

It's a minimal API that provides a great experience to the users.

## Remix is great, but what about [Astro](https://astro.build/)?

As you may already know, Astro is a framework for server side rendering that provides the ability to integrate frontend frameworks to get interactivity in the client. It is not the same kind of (meta) framework than [Remix](https://remix.run/) or [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/).
And as pointed on [their homepage](https://astro.build/), the framework focuses on content websites _for now_.

Basically, regarding froms, it means: use regular HTML forms or the things you have available on your client side framework (e.g: [formik](https://formik.org/) on React, or whatever alternative), or build something yourself.

We are going to try building something as close to what Remix provides as possible knowing that we have the following constraint: we only build user-lands, we can't tweak the inner framework implementation.

It's important to have that in mind. We'll be forced to add a bit of verbosity along the way.

## Let's get into it

I assume you already have an Astro project running locally. If that's not the case, you can create one from [the get started page](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/).

### Create an HTML form

Let's start easy, and rely on progressive enhancement to
