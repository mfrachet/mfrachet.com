title: How feature flags evaluation works?

_This article doesn't aim to explain what are feature flags or when they should be used, but more on explaining the underlying computation happening when a user requests one._

I've been working with feature flags for around a decade now. And in the past few years, I've been working on building my own solution: [Progressively](https://github.com/progressively-crew/progressively). At the beginning, I was building the tool exactly to understand
how feature flags evaluation worked. I was wondering how it was possible to have a system that is able to consistently provide the same value depending on the user, the feature flag and some configuration.

> At some point, I thought I could build a company on top of it. Long story short, I tried to launch the product and I failed to find my early users. At least, I've learned some good things!

Isn't that magical that when a user is requesting a feature flag evaluation, they always get the same result? How is that possible that 10% of the audience will evaluate one variant and 90% will evaluate another one **consistently**?

To fully understand how it works depending on a few cases, let's agree on the following terminology used in the next examples:

- **"The configuration"**: the JSON format storing the feature flags configuration, in a database for example
- **"The user land code"**: the code that is requesting the feature flag evaluation. It's in the final client application (if you are building a feature flag service, it's not in your hands)
- **"The evaluation process"**: how are the feature flags computed for the given configuration and the user.

Let's distill the process.

## One for all system

### The configuration

It's the simplest case. You have a list of feature flags with a very small configuration and their status ("active" or "inactive"). It's basically saying that if the feature flag is active, then everybody will see the feature, otherwise no one will.

```tsx
const flagConfigurations = [
  {
    key: "new-homepage",
    name: "New homepage",
    status: "active",
  },
  {
    key: "blackfriday-banner",
    name: "Black Friday banner",
    status: "inactive",
  },
];
```

### The user land code

```tsx
const App = () => {
  const { flags } = useFlags();

  if (flags.newHomepage) {
    return <NewHomepage />;
  }

  return <OldHomepage />;
};
```

On this snippet, when the `flags.newHomepage` will be evaluated, then the application will render the `NewHomepage` component, otherwise it will render the `OldHomepage` component.

### The evaluation process

The evaluation process is really simple. It's just a matter of checking the configuration and returning the status of the feature flag. There is no notion of the current user here since the evaluation concerns the whole user base.

```tsx
const evaluate = (flagName: string) => {
  // Find the configuration for the given flag name where it is (DB for example, but in our case it's just an in-memory array)
  const flag = flagConfigurations.find((flag) => flag.key === flagName);

  // Return the status of the feature flag
  return flag?.status === "active";
};

const isNewHomepageEnabled = evaluate("new-homepage"); // true / false
```

## Using user properties

### The configuration

The configuration is now a bit different. The user needs to have a property `email` containing the domain `frachet.com` to be eligible for the feature flag evaluation. If the user is not eligible, then the feature flag will be inactive for this user.

```tsx
const flagConfigurations = [
  {
    key: "new-homepage",
    name: "New homepage",
    status: "active",
    conditions: [
      {
        field: "email",
        operator: "contains",
        value: "frachet.com",
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

### The user land code

```tsx
// The user has to explicitly set its properties and send them to the feature flag service,
// otherwise the system is not able to get the needed data to process the evaluation
//
// NB: this is a pseudo code, configuration can be added in a provider higher in the tree.
// This example is simple enough with not too much code to be easy to understand.
setConfiguration({
  user: {
    email: "john.doe@frachet.com",
  },
});

const App = () => {
  const { flags } = useFlags();

  if (flags.newHomepage) {
    return <NewHomepage />;
  }

  return <OldHomepage />;
};
```

### The evaluation process

The evaluation process is changing a bit. Now, we need to know a bit more about the user and check for their eligibility before being able to evaluate the feature flag.

```tsx
// Verify eligibily for the evaluation
const isUserEligible = (user: User, conditions: Conditions) => {
  // If there is no conditions, the user is eligible
  if (conditions.length === 0) return true;

  return conditions.every((condition) => {
    switch (condition.operator) {
      case "contains":
        return user[condition.field].includes(condition.value);
      default:
        return false;
    }
  });
};
```

```tsx
// Evaluate a variant for the given feature flag and user
const evaluate = (flagName: string, user: User) => {
  // Find the configuration for the given flag name where it is (DB for example, but in our case it's just an in-memory array)
  const flag = flagConfigurations.find((flag) => flag.key === flagName);

  // If the flag is not found, early break and return false by default
  if (!flag || flag.status === "inactive") return false;

  return isUserEligible(user, flag.conditions);
};
```

```tsx
// Get the homepage value for the given user
const user: User = {
  email: "john@frachet.com",
};

const isNewHomepageEnabled = evaluate("new-homepage", user); // true / false
```

## Percentage based rollout

The percentage based rollout is a bit more complex than the previous one. The idea is that we want to rollout the feature flag to a percentage of the users. For example, we want to rollout the feature flag to 10% of them.

How to consistently pick up the 10% of users among the whole user base?

The secret is that we will not target exactly and strictly 10% of the users. What I mean here is that if you have 100 users, it is not guaranteed that 10 users will evaluate the "new" variant of the feature flag. It might be 8 or 9 or 10 if we are lucky.

The thing is that we will target 10% in statistical manner. Meaning that for **a very large number of users**, 10% of them will be targeted. The more users there are, the closer to 10% we will get.

Remember, it's only about statistics.

To make it work, we need to get a unique ID from the user and we have multiple options for that:

- asking the user to explicitly set it in the user land configuration (`setConfiguration({ id: "your-id " })` in our example)
- generating a random one using the client side SDK (the client SDK is `useFlags` in our example) and store this ID locally with the browser mechanism (local storage for example)
- generating a random one using the HTTP protocol and using HTTP Cookies to identify the user (on the server side)
- relying on the user agent (browser) on the server side. Convenient if you don't like cookies (this is how [Plausiblehq](https://plausible.io/) is doing private analytics btw)

Each of these options has its pros and cons. Choose the one that makes the most sense for your use case.

We now have a unique identifier (that is very probably a string) across sessions that we can use to make computations. But how can we compare a `string` value to a percentage range?

The answer, which is where the magic happens, is to use a hashing algorithm that is able to convert a string into a number. This hashing algorithm has to run with the avalanch effect: a small modification in the string itself (even just one character) produces a completely different hash.

Lucky we are, this algorithm already exists and is called [MurmurHash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash).

Let's give a real world example:

```tsx
const expectedPercentage = 10; // From the configuration, we want to target 10% of the users
const flagKey = "new-homepage"; // From the configuration
const userId = "0201d641-deb0-4e48-beba-edccf23a17ba"; // Generated using of the above methods

const MAX_INT_32 = Math.pow(2, 32); // Determining the maximum value of a 32 bit integer in JavaScript so that we can convert to percentages
const evaluationKey = `${flagKey}-${userId}`; // creating a unique evaluation key for the given flag and user. It allows to be in different evaluation buckets on different flags.
const hash = murmurhash3(evaluationKey); // computing the hash of the evaluation key
const userFlagPercentage = (hash / MAX_INT_32) * 100; // converting the hash to a percentage

if (userFlagPercentage <= expectedPercentage) {
  return true; // The user is in the 10% of the users targeted by this configuration
}

return false; // The user is not in the 10% of the users targeted by this configuration
```

### The configuration

We've adjusted the configuration to add the `expectedPercentage` field to target the 10% of the users.

```tsx
const flagConfigurations = [
  {
    key: "new-homepage",
    name: "New homepage",
    status: "active",
    expectedPercentage: 10,
    conditions: [
      {
        field: "email",
        operator: "contains",
        value: "frachet.com",
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

### The user land code

```tsx
setConfiguration({
  user: {
    id: "0201d641-deb0-4e48-beba-edccf23a17ba", // we explicitly set it for simplicity
    email: "john.doe@frachet.com",
  },
});

const App = () => {
  const { flags } = useFlags();

  if (flags.newHomepage) {
    return <NewHomepage />;
  }

  return <OldHomepage />;
};
```

### The evaluation process

```tsx
// Verify eligibily for the evaluation
const isUserEligible = (user: User, conditions: Conditions) => {
  // If there is no conditions, the user is eligible
  if (conditions.length === 0) return true;

  return conditions.every((condition) => {
    switch (condition.operator) {
      case "contains":
        return user[condition.field].includes(condition.value);
      default:
        return false;
    }
  });
};
```

```tsx
const evaluateFlagPercentage = (expectedPercentage: number, userId: string) => {
  if (expectedPercentage === 0) return false;
  if (expectedPercentage === 100) return true;

  const MAX_INT_32 = Math.pow(2, 32); // Determining the maximum value of a 32 bit integer in JavaScript so that we can convert to percentages
  const evaluationKey = `${flagKey}-${userId}`; // creating a unique evaluation key for the given flag and user. It allows to be in different evaluation buckets on different flags.
  const hash = murmurhash3(evaluationKey); // computing the hash of the evaluation key
  const userFlagPercentage = (hash / MAX_INT_32) * 100; // converting the hash to a percentage

  return userFlagPercentage <= expectedPercentage;
};
```

```tsx
// Evaluate a variant for the given feature flag and user
const evaluate = (flagName: string, user: User) => {
  // Find the configuration for the given flag name where it is (DB for example, but in our case it's just an in-memory array)
  const flag = flagConfigurations.find((flag) => flag.key === flagName);

  // If the flag is not found, early break and return false by default
  if (!flag || flag.status === "inactive") return false;

  // We always check for eligibility first because when coupling conditions and percentages,
  // we want to say: "show the flag to 10% of the users that fit the conditions"
  // so we first need to check if the user is eligible for the conditions.
  //
  // Otherwise, it would mean: "Take 10% of the whole audience, and check the conditions after which could lead to more users being targeted"
  if (!isUserEligible(user, flag.conditions)) {
    return false;
  }

  return evaluateFlagPercentage(flag.expectedPercentage, user.id);
};
```

```tsx
// Get the homepage value for the given user
const user: User = {
  id: "0201d641-deb0-4e48-beba-edccf23a17ba",
  email: "john@frachet.com",
};

const isNewHomepageEnabled = evaluate("new-homepage", user); // true / false
```
