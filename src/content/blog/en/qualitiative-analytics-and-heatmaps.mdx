Analytics encompasses various forms and the collection of diverse data types.

- **Product analytics**: they aim to measure the success of a product by analyzing user behavior and product usage.
- **Web analytics**: they aim to measure the success of a website by analyzing user website usage (think of Google Analytics, Plausible, etc). They are about numbers.
- **A lot of others**: sales analytics, marketing analytics, etc.

What's fascinating about analytics is that they're always a bit biased.

**Product analytics**, for example, can only tell you about the people that are using the product the way you expected them to. Generally, you create events on specific actions that you have decided are relevant. However, you don't know about other actions: and maybe people are interacting differently than you thought.

**Web analytics** only focus on the numbers and often miss the bigger picture. Sure, you might see a million visitors on your homepage, but those numbers don't tell you if people are interacting with the content in the way you intended. It's a bit like knowing how many guests came to a party without knowing if they had a good time!

The common factor here is that they lack an element: they don't capture how people really interact with your website or product. Maybe your hero CTAs generates less "clicks" than the small contact button at the bottom of the page (this is a gross example, but you get the point)?

## Introducing Qualitative Analytics

Qualitative analytics is about understanding "how" people interact with your website or product. What element are they interacting with? Is it the one you expected? How to re-focus their attention where you want them to?

### ⚠️ Disclaimer

Gathering qualitative data is very intrusive. You have to (and this is a legal requirement in Europe) to inform people that you are about to track them in a very extensive way.

### Representing qualitative data

Before understanding how to implement a solution to gather the qualitative data, let's try to find solution to represent the data in a meaningful way.

### Heatmaps

Heatmaps are a visual representation of zones that are active. The more the color is closed to red, the more the zone is active. The following is an image (taken from Hotjar) that shows a heatmap of a web page.
