In May 2017, I was working in a consulting company ([Zenika](https://zenika.com/)) and I've got a contract with an exciting company that was powering the replay website for the largest french TV channel ([6play](https://www.6play.fr/)).
I've started this new experience as part of a team of four engineers building React Native islands inside a [big native mobile app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.m6.m6replay).

At this time, I wasn't expecting that but one of those four engineers will change my life forever.

One year later, after having worked hardly on those small mobile islands, the project we were working on has stopped and we were split in different teams. I joined the "international team" (or Lemon team internally) where we were supposed to make the streaming platform more open to welcome new RTL channels (the group above M6/6play) to propose their program on the website, and my friends were going elsewhere.

At this moment, I realized that a I was missing a person of my team a bit too much.

After a party organized by our consulting company (yes, she was also part of the same consulting company as me), we decided to try something together and finally ended up spending a whole year in Canada.

The relationship being an extraordinary adventure, we got back to France, spent some time in a beautiful appartement in Alsace ([French region at the frontier of Germany](https://earth.google.com/web/@48.2490582,7.53728725,168.24619957a,396350.73471324d,35y,0h,0t,0r/data=ChAaDgoIL20vMGN4MnIYAiABOgMKATA)) before finally buying a house two years later, in the same region.

_And by the way: renovating a house is a huuuuge project. Difficult, but very rewarding, highly recommend getting the hands dirty and building things._

Time passing and love growing, we finally decided to get engaged and visited the Mordor in Iceland.

After a few months, I was joining a new company and I had to leave my home for a week to get the onboarding done physically. So I left my wife, visited my parents that were leaving ~1h30 far from my new job and got on the train to meet my new team mate.
The second evening, I received a call from my wife: she told me we were going to have a baby and it was planned for June 2023. Funny thing, the baby was supposed to arrive around my birthday, I was secretly wishing he would come this day.

I was very excited this day and eventually got drink sooner that I would expect.
