In May 2017, I was working in a consulting company ([Zenika](https://zenika.com/)) and I've got a contract with an exciting company that was powering the replay website for the largest french TV channel ([6play](https://www.6play.fr/)).
I've started this new experience as part of a team of four engineers building React Native islands inside a [big native mobile app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.m6.m6replay).

At this time, I wasn't expecting that but one of those four engineers will change my life forever.

One year later, after having worked hardly on those small mobile islands, the project we were working on has stopped and we were split in different teams. I joined the "international team" (or Lemon team internally) where we were supposed to make the streaming platform more open to welcome new RTL channels (the group above M6/6play) to propose their program on the website, and my friends were going elsewhere.

At this moment, I realized that a I was missing a person of my team a bit too much.

After a party organized by our consulting company (yes, she was also part of the same consulting company as me), we decided to try something together and finally ended up spending a whole year in Canada.

The relationship being an extraordinary adventure, we got back to France, spent some time in a beautiful appartement in Alsace ([French region at the frontier of Germany](https://earth.google.com/web/@48.2490582,7.53728725,168.24619957a,396350.73471324d,35y,0h,0t,0r/data=ChAaDgoIL20vMGN4MnIYAiABOgMKATA)) before finally buying a house two years later, in the same region.

_And by the way: renovating a house is a huuuuge project. Difficult, but very rewarding, highly recommend getting the hands dirty and building things._

Time passing and love growing, we finally decided to get engaged and visited the Mordor in Iceland.

After a few months, I was joining a new company and I had to leave my home for a week to get the onboarding done physically. So I left my wife, visited my parents that were leaving ~1h30 far from my new job and got on the train to meet my new team mate.
The second evening, I received a call from my wife: she told me we were going to have a baby and it was planned for June 2023. Funny thing, the baby was supposed to arrive around my birthday (I was secretly wishing).

🍺🍺🍺 I was very excited this day and eventually got drink sooner that I would expect.

Months have past, my wife being was breathing life joy. The pregnancy was going very well and our baby was very dynamic, and from the echography he was moving the arms a lot and trying to push on his feets just like he was going to walk at birth.

The 23rd of May, we were going for a short walk of 20minutes around the neighbour when she told me that she felt contractions differently. She already had small ones during pregnancy but didn't pay too much attention: it was a usual business from what the doctor told us.

After this short walk, we finally got back home and played a video game when she told me: "Contractions are weird, and they are very closed to each others".
We finally ended up at the hospital where the "real" work started: in the car, contractions were going stronger and stronger and once arrived, the doctor announced us that the baby will arrive during the night or on the next day.

The excitement was there: we are going to be parent and have our first child 🧒. As expected, the night was a long night of work and pain until 9.20am finally ringed on the 24th of May. Our baby boy Émile is born.

One thing that nobody could have expected is that my little boy, at birth time, has ingested Meconium (which honestly looks like Venom from Marvel) that has gotten into his lungs. The problem with Meconium is that it's basically baby poo and that it sticks a lot. My babyboy was having baby poo stucking his lungs and was not able to breath as expected.

We didn't even had the opportunity to say hello to the little thing that he was directly transported through the different emergancy services at the hospital until he finally got to the "reanimation service". This place is the most stressing place you can ever be. It's a service where the (amazing) people deal with baby that come way too early or that are in a very complicated situation without knowing if they will live or not.
