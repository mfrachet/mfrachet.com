In May 2017, I was working in a consulting agency ([Zenika](https://zenika.com/)) and I've got a contract with an exciting company that was powering the replay website for the largest french TV channel ([6play](https://www.6play.fr/)).
I've started this new experience as part of a team of four engineers building React Native islands inside a [big native mobile app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.m6.m6replay).

At this time, I wasn't expecting that one of those four engineers will change my life forever.

One year later, after having worked hardly on those mobile islands, the project has been stopped and we were split in different, separate, teams. I joined the "international" one (or _Lemon team_ internally) where we were supposed to make the streaming platform more open to welcome new RTL (the group owning M6/6play) channels and programs.

On the same week-end, my consulting agency organized a skiing party where one of my previous coworker was part of (yes, she was also working for Zenika). After a not so long conversation, we decided to try something together.

Some months later, we've taken a plane and spent a whole year in Canada.

The relationship being an extraordinary adventure across the ocean, we decided to go back to France and think about the future. We spent some time in a beautiful appartement in Alsace ([French region at the frontier of Germany](https://earth.google.com/web/@48.2490582,7.53728725,168.24619957a,396350.73471324d,35y,0h,0t,0r/data=ChAaDgoIL20vMGN4MnIYAiABOgMKATA)) before finally buying a house two years later, in the same region.

_And by the way: renovating a house is a huuuuge project. Difficult, but very rewarding, highly recommend getting the hands dirty and building things._

Time passing and love growing, we finally decided to get engaged and visited the Mordor in Iceland.

A few month later, I was joining a new company and I had to leave my home for a week to get the onboarding done physically. So I left my wife, visited my parents that were leaving ~1h30 far from my new job and got on the train to meet my new team mates.
The second evening, I received a call from my wife: she told me we were going to have a baby and it was planned for June 2023. Funny thing, the baby was supposed to arrive around my birthday.

üç∫üç∫üç∫ I was very excited and eventually got drink sooner that I would expect on that day.

Months have past, my wife was breathing life joy. The pregnancy was going very well and our baby was very dynamic. From the echography he was moving the arms a lot and trying to push on his feets just like he was going to walk at birth.

The 23rd of May, we were going for a short walk of 20 minutes around the neighbour when she told me that she felt contractions differently. She already had small ones during pregnancy but didn't pay too much attention: it was a usual business from what the doctor told us.

After this short walk, we finally got back home and played a video game when she told me: "Contractions are weird, and they are very closed to each others".
We finally ended up at the hospital where the real work started. In the car, contractions were going stronger and stronger and once arrived, the doctor announced us that the baby will arrive during the night or on the next day.

The excitement was there: we are going to be parents and have our first child üßí. As expected, the night was a long one of work and pain until 9.20am finally ringed on the 24th of May. Our baby boy √âmile is born.

One thing that nobody could have expected is that my little boy, at birth time, has ingested Meconium (which honestly looks like Venom from Marvel) that has gotten into his lungs. The problem with Meconium is that it's basically baby poo and that it sticks a lot. My babyboy was having baby poo stucking his lungs and was not able to breath as expected.

We didn't even had the opportunity to say hello to the little thing that he was directly transported through the different emergancy services at the hospital until he finally got to the "reanimation service". This place is the most stressing place you can ever be. It's a service where the (amazing) people deal with babies that come way too early or that are in a very complicated situation without knowing if they will live or not.

We spent two weeks here, sleeping at the hospital, wishing for the baby to be okay.

Days were passing way too slowly, we had to feed the baby using a pipette, putting milk inside and pushing so that it got directly to the stomach. We were not authorized to hold him for obvious reasons, we were standing here, waiting for the doctors to finally come and tell us something.

Some of those days that felt like a century finally passed until a doctor accompanied by a genetician came at us to explain that our baby may have physical details that could lead them thinking he might have a genetical pathology. That they would like to make blood test and will inform us about the situation one week later.

Hearing those sentances while being tortured by the health situation of the child was not helping us going better. The days that felt like centuries were then feeling like inifinity. We were clearly not prepared to hear that.

In a week, I've lost around 5 kg, I was not able to eat. Sleeping was not very resting. I don't know how we managed that, but we finally got to the so awaited day, which was also the day we were supposed to leave the hospital.

Verdict: our little √âmile is born with [Down syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome).

This was honestly another hammer hit on top of the head. We were, again, not prepared for such a scenario. In France, during the pregnancy, you do a bunch of tests that give you a score which is basically a probability. According to that score, we were clearly not in the range of a high risk to have a baby with Down syndrome.

This was the day we finally got back home. To be honest, the excitment was not there. I remember, while driving, having seen a dad and his two kids riding bikes on the street and I was wondering if I will be able to do the same with my son. The feeling of jealousy was there. But the most terrifying one was that we thought we will be alone, the 3 us, until the end. We cried a lot in the first week.

People told us things will go better with time. When you have the head under the water, it's hard to hear that and to understand what they mean. The thing is: it's true, time helps. We have to embrace pain, understand it and do our best to heal.

To help us, we have been in contact with a psychologist, for obvious reasons and for dealing with the mourning of "the expected child".

It has been 5 months that we now live with √âmile. Ooh gang, what a funny little boy! He smiles a billion times a day, he loves to eat and gymnastic (we have kinesitherapist sessions multiple times a week, and he loves that so much). We don't think of him as a "Down" person anymore.
Now, it's just our child, we love him and he gives this back by a thousand.

We were fearing to be alone in this life for, honestly, no real reasons, and I think it's because we were burnt so much at that point that thinking was just too painful. But the reality is that our friends love the little boy,
the family has fallen in love with these smiles and almond eyes.

_He loves food so much that he yells at us when the spoon does not arrive fast enough ü§£._

My boy is different, but who is not after all?
